# Japanese Character Recognition

:warning: **Note:** This repository is unmaintained, but I'm leaving it online in case it's useful to anyone. Make sure to check the issues if you're going to use this in any way.

Android application used to recognize hand-written Japanese katakana characters. Uses tensorflow to train a model with convolutional neural networks using a set of images for training.

The goal of this repository is not to get a production-ready application, but rather to provide an example project integrating TensorFlow and Android.

## Training the model

In order for the Android application to recognize characters, a model should be trained first using the tensorflow python library.

Before doing so, the training data needs to be obtained from the following website: [http://etlcdb.db.aist.go.jp/](http://etlcdb.db.aist.go.jp/). The file `ETL1.zip` should be placed under the `data/raw` folder.

The easiest way to run tensorflow with python is using the tensorflow/tensorflow docker image. With [docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/), this image can be built and run using the following command from the cloned repository folder:

```
docker run -it -p 6006:6006 -v `pwd`:/Japanese-Character-Recognition -w /Japanese-Character-Recognition tensorflow/tensorflow:1.1.0 bash
```

Once inside the docker container, it's optional (but recommended) to launch tensorboard to monitor the training progress, the web interface can be used at [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006). Launch it on the background with the following command:

```
tensorboard --logdir="data/training_summaries/" &
```

And finally, prepare images data and train the model running the following scripts:

```
python data/prepare.py
python train_model.py
```

Once the training is completed (which may take a while, it took me 35 minutes with the parameters present in this repository), a file will be generated with the name `model.pb` on the root folder. This file contains the parameters of the trained model, which will be used in the Android application in order to recognize characters. To reduce the complexity, I only used 7 characters: アイウエオカキク (this can be configured in the `prepare.py` script). Tuning diferent parameters in the `train_model.py` file and using a different dataset could improve the results; this can be tested looking at the tensorboard graphics: The accuracy should improve in every training step approaching an accuracy of 100%. The following screenshot shows the graphics for my training, it can be observed how the last steps are between 90% and 100% accuracy. It should be noted that even though this tells us an accuracy greater than 90%, it is suffering from overfitting with the current setup.

Once the model is generated, files `model.pb` and `data/katakana/categories.csv` should be copied into the folder `android/app/src/main/assets` for the Android application to use.

## Building the Android app

The application is a standard Android app, so it can be built using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/index.html) or any other standard Android build system.
